# MusicManager
A bot created in C# and with the use of Bot Framework and LUIS AI from Microsoft that can store tracks, albums and artists based on the commands given by the user.
You can also get back the list of all the tracks associated with an album or artist.

This project is made in Visual Studio 2017 and you can use git commands to clone this or just download and import it in Visual Studio as a project.

The solution has two projects -

1. ConsoleApp1 - Involves basic skeleton code which does all the actual work - adding and getting of tracks/albums/artists.
2. MusicBot - This project connects the whole program with LUIS AI and uses the commands to get the intent.

More functionality being added as you read this...
